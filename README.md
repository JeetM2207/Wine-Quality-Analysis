# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis

This project performs an in-depth analysis and prediction of wine quality using machine learning techniques. It explores various data preprocessing, visualization, and classification approaches to determine factors that impact wine quality.

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- **Features**: 11 physicochemical attributes (like acidity, pH, alcohol, etc.)
- **Target**: Quality score (0-10)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Null value detection
- Distribution plots for all features
- Correlation heatmap
- Feature importance analysis

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

Each model was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Performance metrics like:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix
- ROC Curve (if implemented)

## 🧪 Results

- Feature(s) like **alcohol**, **volatile acidity**, and **sulphates** showed strong correlation with wine quality.
- The best-performing model (e.g., Random Forest) achieved an accuracy of **~X%** (fill this based on your results).
